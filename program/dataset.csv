B0BYLLR7QZ,"September 21, 2024",TRUE,5,‼️🚨 BEST RENEWED IPHONE,"Overall Review ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - This was a super easy, affordable and quick solution to buying a phone in a pinch. I ordered the product at 3pm on a Thursday and it was delivered at my door by Friday lunch time. -The product came in the normal Amazon box packing with paper to insure a safe travel. The phone itself is in amazing condition, works great and is infact unlocked. Product Condition 🔥 -This iPhone had NO scratches NO dents and came prepackaged in amazons official renewal packaging. The phone itself was even wrapped in a plastic film to protect it. -The touch screen works great and has no scratches. - The camera has no scratches and the picture quality is 10/10. -My speaker works great and is loud 📢 compared to my previous phone. -The phone even came with a charger.

B0BYLLR7QZ,"January 05, 2024",TRUE,5,Wonderful product and would recommend!,"I had an older android and was having a hard time deciding what, and when to get, a new phone. I love Android and I was really intrigued with the Google and Asus phones. I have had a galaxy since the beginning of smart phones it would seem. Well, looking at all options as well, the red iPhone caught my attention solely in color. I know IPhone is a good phone, for the most part, everyone I know seems to have iPhone or Galaxy. I have never owned an iPhone and they are much more expensive than the phones I was looking at. But the red iPhone, I just kept coming back to. I started looking into the differences, and then started looking into refurbished. I have also never purchased a refurbished phone. The price difference for a “Premium” or “excellent” condition iPhone, was significantly cheaper than buying brand new. I went back and forth on Amazon, with different sellers based on reviews, and ended up landing in the option where it is sold and shipped by Amazon themselves (which I thought was more likely to be exactly what is described in their product page). I will say the first try to purchase did not go through, so there were some issues with the monthly insurance plan for the phone. But the second time it did go through, and I was having to wait probably 4 days for it to get here. I was so excited, like a kid waiting for Christmas to get here. Finally the iPhone arrived, and in absolute perfect condition. I went with the “premium refurbished” option. The delivery was incredibly secure and the driver was extra helpful before they arrived so we could time it. I opened the box and there is not one scratch or thing that would tell you that this isn’t a brand new phone. It comes with a charger, block and the phone information on a leaflet (that would otherwise be in the original iPhone packaging). I did wait to activate it, until I had time to go into a physical carrier store, but I backed up everything before I did that in my old phone. It took maybe 5 minutes for the associate at my carrier store, to set the iPhone up and transfer everything I wanted from my galaxy and the service, to the iPhone. I was worried based on other reviews that it could possibly not be unlocked to all carriers, but it was. One of the main reasons I chose to buy the refurbished option from the sold by/ships by Amazon option, because I trusted the accuracy of the description more. ALL THAT SAID beautiful phone, looks brand new, works like it’s brand new, has 100% battery life out of the box and is very easy to get used to (even if you have had an android all your adult life). I definitely recommend this product and Amazon as the seller to ensure you get what you are looking for. I am SO happy with my purchase and when it comes time to get a new phone a few years from now, I will be starting here this time! The RED color is beautiful!!!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGKIFMGROKYW2/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BYLLR7QZ,Apple iPhone 14,Unlocked,Red,256GB
B0BYLLR7QZ,"February 08, 2024",TRUE,1,Brick Stolen Device,"If I could send negative stars I would. The phone looked great and it was a great deal;however the device was unable to be activated due to it being reported lost or stolen. This was for a teenager who had already been without a phone for 3days now having to return the device. The customer service representative had no idea what I was talking about. I’ve worked in the cell phone industry, when a phone especially an iPhone is reported lost or stolen you cannot activate the device ANYWHERE hence the name brick it’s basically as good as a brick. I was told nothing could be done about it while I just ship the phone back half to waive for my $700 to be refunded to me while my teenager is still waiting without a phone and I’m without money. I’ve also had all carriers and not one made me sit without a phone or a refund processed right away. To top it off I asked to speak to a supervisor and when I told the supervisor the phone was reported lost or stolen she called me a liar and told me that’s simply not true!! Amazon did not do its due diligence by inspecting the phone properly. There is a national database for lost/stolen phones if they did they job accurately and checked not one but both the IMEI’s since it only has an eSIM they would have caught that it was reported! But for an Amazon employee to call me a liar? Are you kidding me? Don’t buy a “renewed” device from Amazon or risk having a yourself $500-$700 brick losing out of money and being without a phone! Not even an adjustments credits nothing but being humiliated without money and no product.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IY403NFUOA5N/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BYLLR7QZ,Apple iPhone 14,Unlocked,Midnight,128GB

Obviously she’s not into having the latest phones so we thought this was the best option. We got refurbished premium hoping we don’t need to return for whatever reason but making sure we are covered for at least a year. Looks great almost new. Has a very tiny scratch on the lower side of the front screen but nothing you can see right away. Came with 100% battery as you can see. Came with a charger that works just fine. Very well taken care of packaged well and all. Sound is good too and everything works fine so far. I will definitely buy again as the prices seem wayyyy more reasonable.

B0BGQKY8S9,"August 31, 2024",TRUE,5,Like a brand new iPhone,"So I was really pretty skeptical at first of buying a refurbished iPhone off of Amazon no less, but I was in desperate need of a new phone and Amazon partners with Affirm so I could finance, so I carefully read through the reviews and ultimately ordered the dark green iPhone 13 back in April and here I am in almost September and I can’t even tell you how happy and impressed I am with this phone!! Not a SINGLE scratch, dent, crack or any indication of cosmetic damage whatsoever, came with original charger and pamphlets, started up perfectly, transferred over my sd card and my phone service to this phone without a SINGLE hitch, works like brand new, camera quality is up to par, battery health is 100%, speakers and audio are perfect! So glad I went this route and bought a refurbished iPhone through Amazon and didn’t spend hundreds more at a phone store! If you’re on the fence, I definitely recommend!! I feel I should also mention real quick that only about a WEEK after I got the phone I dropped it the freaking TOILET and at first I was HORRIFIED, I of course majorly panicked and acted very quickly so it was only in water for a few seconds and I dried it off as thoroughly as physically possible (don’t use rice!) but I of course am so relieved to say that even after that incident the phone is still in perfect operating condition!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DJ5P20U9TFZU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BGQKY8S9,Apple iPhone 13,Unlocked,Green,128GB
B0BGQKY8S9,"September 08, 2024",TRUE,5,Renewed premium excellent so far,"Just got my “renewed premium” iPhone 13 from Amazon and by all accounts it’s excellent and pristine — even the packaging was impressive. Honestly, it just seems like a brand-spanking new iPhone but $200 cheaper than the same refurbished iPhone from Apple. It looks flawless, and the battery is at 100% capacity that doesn’t always appear to always be the case with just “renewed” products. It was a bit of a risk, but with the backing of Amazon I decided to give it a shot and SO GLAD I did. Highly recommended!!! And I’ll report back if any eventual downsides, but I highly doubt it given what I’m seeing right now. Especially if you have kids, Amazon Renewed Premium is absolutely the way to go!!! But I’ll definitely do this again for my next iPhone upgrade if this holds up.

B07ZZM8P2S,"March 29, 2023",TRUE,1,Is Renewed Premium worth the extra money?,"Update (12/17/23): Additional observations: 1) the Amazon Renewed certification card is marked 10/27/23, and when I received it 12/2/23 (about 5 weeks), the battery was completely dead; 2) after charging back to 100%, I put it in airplane mode (to turn off both WiFi and bluetooth), and also put it in battery saver mode; I checked the battery percentages once a day, and it was losing 10-15% per day, so this battery is very weak. I did a parallel test with another iPhone (11 pro max), and that one only lost 10% (100% > 90%) over a week. This is an excellent test to check the true condition of the battery. Update (12/15/23): Ordered a 5th Amazon Premium Renewed phone (iPhone 12 Pro Max), and the battery life, which should be above 90%, is actually 88%. Update (3/28/23): After lengthy discussions with Amazon, they will not honor the 90% battery guarantee stated on the Amazon Premium Renewed page, because it is ""not stated on the Amazon invoice"". 1-star, no longer recommended. Update (2/1/23): Ran into some issues, probably things that should be checked upon receipt of a renewed or premium renewed product: 1) battery life [below advertised 80 or 90%], 2) parts replaced, either with genuine or non-genuine Apple parts, 3) overall functionality [defective charging port]. Reducing overall rating to 4-stars. Summary: Upgrading from an iPhone 7 plus, and decided I would go with the 11 Pro Max version. I was on the fence whether the extra money for the premium renewed is worth it, so will be discussing what I considered. Observations: The high level basic differences are: 1) about a $100 difference; 2) three vs. 12 months return period: 3) battery level of 80% vs. 90%. Recommendation: After considering the factors, I decided to look into how much a replacement battery would cost, which is $40 right now. However, starting with the iPhone 8 (i think), Apple started sealing the cases, which requires a heat gun to separate the case because of the extra waterproofing adhesive. To breakdown the addition $100 cost, subtract the $40 battery from that, leaving $60 for an additional 9-months (or $6.67/month) to ""insurance"" to return the phone if issues come up. Carrier Lock: I decided I wanted an unlocked version, and that appears to be another feature that is included with Premium Renewed, with the majority of carrier locked versions being offered as renewed only. Conclusion: For the additional $100, I elected to go with the Renewed Premium. I rate both the Renewed and the Premium Renewed as 5-stars.

The phone was neatly packaged and wrapped, came with a charger and a sim card opener + the amazon renewed paper. It had a couple scratches on the sides but they were very minor & not noticeable at all. The screen was very clear no cracks. My only issue is the screen when it’s turned on. It had this weird mild & subtle static & I can see a faint black grain when I am staring closely to the phone. Now I understand this phone is refurbished & renewed but I won’t lie the screen when I have the phone on really bugs me. I would be lying if I said I am totally satisfied with this phone. Not to mention the phone is kinda slow, it lags & the battery life I received when I when I went to the settings was at an 80 % .. *sighs* , trying to decide if I should thug it out & be delusional or just send the phone back even tho I fear the quality of phone I’d received next. I’ve contacted the seller .. I haven’t heard anything yet. I’ll update soon. Update : Ive decided to return the phone because I feel like I would be settling if I had to keep this phone. I will say though I am surprised the phone came in a very good condition. But truly there were internal hardware and software issues in terms of the static screen flickering/blinking that I just couldn't overlook. The seller has been responsive and cooperative.

B09LNSNZM8,"April 18, 2024",TRUE,3,1st order = low quality replacement screen; but returned/swapped for good phone,"Initially, we got a phone from this vendor that was a dud (for us). We returned it and tried them a 2nd time. The 2nd phone seems a decent deal. For the first phone (iPhone 13) we received: The battery life on the renewed phone was fairly good - at 94% of original capacity. This had been an issue with phones from this vendor per other reviews but was not an issue with ours. However, this renewed phone had a non-Apple replacement screen that was noticeably low in quality - grainy, with colors dulled, and it cut off part of the display area. Touch responsiveness was bad. Given Amazon pledge that the product was ""professionally inspected and tested by Amazon-qualified supplier,"" I feel the substandard screen should have been spotted and the lower quality disclosed. My family member and my time were wasted by this attempt to pass off a lower quality solution. Return process was easy, although it did require a trip to the UPS store. For the second, replacement (iPhone 13) phone: The replacement for the returned 1st phone arrived quickly. The battery life seems great (100% of original capacity). The screen this time is MUCH better than the low quality screen on the original phone.

B09LNSNZM8,"August 23, 2024",TRUE,5,Pleasantly surprised,"So let me start out by saying that I am not one to purchased refurbished phones and whenever something would happen to one of mine and I had to turn it into the Phone company and they would send me a refurbished one to replace mine, there was always something wrong with them. So, that has always made me a little bit gunshy regarding that particular situation. With that said, as a full-time caregiver for the last 11 years, I have not been able to work and unfortunately can no longer purchase the best of the best with the flagship phones that I used to get back in the day. Many of my parents doctors do some video visits and some of them actually prefer FaceTime so as a result, having an iPhone was actually partly a necessity for that reason. I have always been an Android girl, )still have that too), so I didn’t quite know what iPhone I needed to get, but after some research, I finally settled on what I thought would be the best choice for me both with regard to the technology inside and with the price as well as the warranty. I had actually considered either an iPhone 11 or an iPhone 13 as my choice. As we are now on the 15 I found the 13 to be the wisest choice of the two. After researching many different sites, some very reputable and actually recommended by people, I decided to land on Amazon‘s renewed program because I’ve always had a nice experience when there have been any issues with a product and I’ve never had any problems with customer service. They’ve always been very helpful and I thought if anything were to happen with the phone, I would be hoping to have the same type of experience. In looking at the options, I chose to actually pay more to have one that was put forth by Amazon themselves because they offered a year warranty as opposed to many of the others who were a bit cheaper and offered maybe 30 days or so etc. And hey, so far, so good! The Phone arrived. It was in perfect cosmetic condition and I have not had any issues with it since. The battery was at 87% and although I would’ve liked to had it higher than that, I was glad to see that it still was pretty snappy when I needed it to be. So I would say that I have been very pleased so far and I would absolutely recommend the renewed program to anyone interested, but can only speak to the actual product provided by Amazon itself, however, I’m sure many of the third-party individuals that sell refurbished items may have some really good product themselves.

B08159ZYCB,"August 21, 2024",TRUE,4,Phone came in good condition !,"This phone looks nice, really, honestly. The phone was neatly packaged and wrapped, came with a charger and a sim card opener + the amazon renewed paper. It had a couple scratches on the sides but they were very minor & not noticeable at all. The screen was very clear no cracks. My only issue is the screen when it’s turned on. It had this weird mild & subtle static & I can see a faint black grain when I am staring closely to the phone. Now I understand this phone is refurbished & renewed but I won’t lie the screen when I have the phone on really bugs me. I would be lying if I said I am totally satisfied with this phone. Not to mention the phone is kinda slow, it lags & the battery life I received when I when I went to the settings was at an 80 % .. *sighs* , trying to decide if I should thug it out & be delusional or just send the phone back even tho I fear the quality of phone I’d received next. I’ve contacted the seller .. I haven’t heard anything yet. I’ll update soon. Update : Ive decided to return the phone because I feel like I would be settling if I had to keep this phone. I will say though I am surprised the phone came in a very good condition. But truly there were internal hardware and software issues in terms of the static screen flickering/blinking that I just couldn't overlook. The seller has been responsive and cooperative. I am thankful. I pray I get my money back on time. As of right now id rate my experience an 8/10 !",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TXLN5J9QBEWT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08159ZYCB,Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max,Unlocked,Space Gray,256GB
