B0BYLLR7QZ,9/21/2024,TRUE,5,‼️🚨 BEST RENEWED IPHONE,"Overall Review ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - This was a super easy, affordable and quick solution to buying a phone in a pinch.

B0BYLLR7QZ,1/5/2024,TRUE,5,Wonderful product and would recommend!,"I had an older android and was having a hard time deciding what, and when to get, a new phone. I love Android and I was really intrigued with the Google and Asus phones. I have had a galaxy since the beginning of smart phones it would seem. Well, looking at all options as well, the  Red iPhone caught my attention solely in color. I know IPhone is a good phone, for the most part, everyone I know seems to have iPhone or Galaxy. I have never owned an iPhone and they are much more expensive than the phones I was looking at. But the  Red iPhone, I just kept coming back to. I started looking into the differences, and then started looking into refurbished. I have also never purchased a refurbished phone. The price difference for a “Premium” or “excellent” condition iPhone, was significantly cheaper than buying brand new. I went back and forth on Amazon, with different sellers based on reviews, and ended up landing in the option where it is sold and shipped by Amazon themselves (which I thought was more likely to be exactly what is described in their product page). I will say the first try to purchase did not go through, so there were some issues with the monthly insurance plan for the phone. But the second time it did go through, and I was having to wait probably 4 days for it to get here. I was so excited, like a kid waiting for Christmas to get here. Finally the iPhone arrived, and in absolute perfect condition. I went with the “premium refurbished” option. The delivery was inc Redibly secure and the driver was extra helpful before they arrived so we could time it. I opened the box and there is not one scratch or thing that would tell you that this isn’t a brand new phone. It comes with a charger, block and the phone information on a leaflet (that would otherwise be in the original iPhone packaging). I did wait to activate it, until I had time to go into a physical carrier store, but I backed up everything before I did that in my old phone. It took maybe 5 minutes for the associate at my carrier store, to set the iPhone up and transfer everything I wanted from my galaxy and the service, to the iPhone. I was worried based on other reviews that it could possibly not be unlocked to all carriers, but it was. One of the main reasons I chose to buy the refurbished option from the sold by/ships by Amazon option, because I trusted the accuracy of the description more. ALL THAT SAID beautiful phone, looks brand new, works like it’s brand new, has 100% battery life out of the box and is very easy to get used to (even if you have had an android all your adult life). I definitely recommend this product and Amazon as the seller to ensure you get what you are looking for. I am SO happy with my purchase and when it comes time to get a new phone a few years from now, I will be starting here this time! The  Red color is beautiful!!!",Apple iPhone 14,  Red,256GB
B0BYLLR7QZ,2/8/2024,TRUE,1,Brick Stolen Device,"If I could send negative stars I would. The phone looked great and it was a great deal;however the device was unable to be activated due to it being reported lost or stolen. This was for a teenager who had already been without a phone for 3days now having to return the device. The customer service representative had no idea what I was talking about. I’ve worked in the cell phone industry, when a phone especially an iPhone is reported lost or stolen you cannot activate the device ANYWHERE hence the name brick it’s basically as good as a brick. I was told nothing could be done about it while I just ship the phone back half to waive for my $700 to be refunded to me while my teenager is still waiting without a phone and I’m without money. I’ve also had all carriers and not one made me sit without a phone or a refund processed right away. To top it off I asked to speak to a supervisor and when I told the supervisor the phone was reported lost or stolen she called me a liar and told me that’s simply not true!! Amazon did not do its due diligence by inspecting the phone properly. There is a national database for lost/stolen phones if they did they job accurately and checked not one but both the IMEI’s since it only has an eSIM they would have caught that it was reported! But for an Amazon employee to call me a liar? Are you kidding me? Don’t buy a “renewed” device from Amazon or risk having a yourself $500-$700 brick losing out of money and being without a phone! Not even an adjustments c Redits nothing but being humiliated without money and no product.",Apple iPhone 14,Midnight,128GB

Es la primera vez que adquiero un producto re acondicionado, en este caso PREMIUM, y con esta experiencia lo volvería a hacer sin duda.",Apple iPhone 14,Midnight,512GB
B0BGQKY8S9,10/11/2024,TRUE,5,Great phone!,"I’ve been using this phone for almost 3 months now, I have had absolutely zero issues with it so far. The phone came in perfect condition with no scratches, cracks, etc. The sound and camera quality of it is also absolutely perfect and the maximum battery capacity also came in at 100% and is still at that. The last phone I had received from Amazon had battery issues, it constantly restarted, came in with access glue around the screen, and ran slow, so I was pretty nervous ordering another phone off of here. But I am really glad I gave it another chance! I would definitely recommend!",Apple iPhone 13,Midnight,128GB
B0BGQKY8S9,11/15/2024,TRUE,5,Looks great,I bought my mom this iobone 13 as her iPhone 7 was going out & she needed to upgrade. Obviously she’s not into having the latest phones so we thought this was the best option. We got refurbished premium hoping we don’t need to return for whatever reason but making sure we are cove Red for at least a year. Looks great almost new. Has a very tiny scratch on the lower side of the front screen but nothing you can see right away. Came with 100% battery as you can see. Came with a charger that works just fine. Very well taken care of packaged well and all. Sound is good too and everything works fine so far. I will definitely buy again as the prices seem wayyyy more reasonable. I will update if anything changes.,Apple iPhone 13,Midnight,128GB
B0BGQKY8S9,8/31/2024,TRUE,5,Like a brand new iPhone,"So I was really pretty skeptical at first of buying a refurbished iPhone off of Amazon no less, but I was in desperate need of a new phone and Amazon partners with Affirm so I could finance, so I carefully read through the reviews and ultimately orde Red the dark green iPhone 13 back in April and here I am in almost September and I can’t even tell you how happy and impressed I am with this phone!! Not a SINGLE scratch, dent, crack or any indication of cosmetic damage whatsoever, came with original charger and pamphlets, started up perfectly, transfer Red over my sd card and my phone service to this phone without a SINGLE hitch, works like brand new, camera quality is up to par, battery health is 100%, speakers and audio are perfect! So glad I went this route and bought a refurbished iPhone through Amazon and didn’t spend hund Reds more at a phone store! If you’re on the fence, I definitely recommend!! I feel I should also mention real quick that only about a WEEK after I got the phone I dropped it the freaking TOILET and at first I was HORRIFIED, I of course majorly panicked and acted very quickly so it was only in water for a few seconds and I dried it off as thoroughly as physically possible (don’t use rice!) but I of course am so relieved to say that even after that incident the phone is still in perfect operating condition!",Apple iPhone 13,Green,128GB
B0BGQKY8S9,9/8/2024,TRUE,5,Renewed premium excellent so far,"Just got my “renewed premium” iPhone 13 from Amazon and by all accounts it’s excellent and pristine — even the packaging was impressive. Honestly, it just seems like a brand-spanking new iPhone but $200 cheaper than the same refurbished iPhone from Apple. It looks flawless, and the battery is at 100% capacity that doesn’t always appear to always be the case with just “renewed” products. It was a bit of a risk, but with the backing of Amazon I decided to give it a shot and SO GLAD I did. Highly recommended!!! And I’ll report back if any eventual downsides, but I highly doubt it given what I’m seeing right now. Especially if you have kids, Amazon Renewed Premium is absolutely the way to go!!! But I’ll definitely do this again for my next iPhone upgrade if this holds up. I’m thrilled!!!",Apple iPhone 13,Midnight,128GB

B0DK15MBHN,10/22/2024,TRUE,1,DO NOT BUY!!! BE WARE,"I’m inc Redibly frustrated with my experience purchasing the iPhone 15 Pro Max. I received what I thought was a brand-new device back in May 2024, but it turns out I was sold a refurbished phone that hasn’t even been paid off. Now, several months later, I’m dealing with an activation lock because the original buyer didn’t settle their account. The phone itself is impressive—great camera quality, smooth performance, and a sleek design. However, that’s overshadowed by the major issue of not being able to use it. I’ve reached out to customer service multiple times, but the resolution process has been frustratingly slow. In short, if you’re considering buying this phone, I strongly advise against it. You risk ending up with a locked device that you can’t use. Save yourself the hassle and look elsewhere!",Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max,White Titanium,256GB

B0DK15MBHN,11/7/2024,TRUE,1,Incorrect Storage and Poor Condition,"I was disappointed to receive a device with the wrong storage capacity; I orde Red the 1 TB version but received only 512GB. The product also had noticeable signs of wear, with scratches on the metal frame and a screen protector that was poorly installed and smudged. The overall condition did not meet my expectations for a quality device.",Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max,White Titanium,1TB
B0DK15MBHN,11/2/2024,TRUE,1,iPhone came with IMEI locked to Carrier and locked in a contract with Boost,"I can't believe this - I had to transfer my physical sim because it came WITHOUT a sim tray, only to find out I couldn't activate my dual sims because 1 IMEI is still locked to a US provider (Boost Mobile) and I'm in Canada. Upon calling Boost directly, they said the phone was still on a plan and they could not help me, or remove the lock on the IMEI. I now don't have a phone or phone number I can use when I return this to Amazon. I'm basically WITHOUT a phone. Thanks a bunch guys. I would have given you 1 star - if the phone was in bad condition, but it's good. Thanks for making this a most PAINFUL experience and suck all the joy out of receiving a new iPhone.",Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max,Blue Titanium,1TB
B0DK15MBHN,10/7/2024,TRUE,5,Love it!,"Phone came in pristine condition. No micro scratches. Came with a screen protector already added on, cable and brick.

B0DK15MBHN,9/21/2024,TRUE,3,Physical Condition Is Ok But Weird Stuff are Happening,"I’ve had this phone for a week now and to be honest it’s in a good condition and not an excellent one as the seller has stated. I’ll list the pros and cons below. Pros: 98% battery No scratches on screen Cons: Scratches and chips around camera rings and body. Phone is glitchy. My apple carplay freezes every time I connect it to my car and I’m experiencing multiple app crashes and sometimes the phone randomly mute all audio and I have to restart the phone. I also was on a video call yesterday and the phone randomly restarted which was really weird I did ask multiple of my friends that have this phone if they’re having these issues and they also said no, which makes me wonder if this is an hardware issue vs a software. I will give the phone a couple more weeks and if nothing changes I will have to return it.",Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max,Black Titanium,512GB

B0CRJS6CTQ,10/17/2024,TRUE,1,Avoid avoid,This phone is defective and I went to return it because I paid for the premium (365 return window) and the seller is now stating they want a 50% restocking fee because it doesn’t have the “original seal”.

This is the 3rd refurbished phone I’ve ever bought and by far the best one I’ve had, no dents no scratches I genuinely would have had no idea the phone was a refurb if I wasn’t the one who purchased it! Battery health is on 100% too!! The ONLY downside that kinda irritated me was that it didn’t come with a block. No big deal though. Initially I was on the fence because I’ve never purchased anything this pricey from Amazon but it was well worth it! I will say one thing that threw me off was the E-Sim, I went to take mine out of my old phone and realized pretty quick that this phone doesn’t need a physical sim. Set up was extremely easy and the color is so beautiful!",Apple iPhone 15,Green,256GB

I always suspected Apple was overhyped. Now I'm convinced I was absolutely right. I really can't think of any  Redeeming qualities. Maybe there was a time when Apple was a superior product. But my 8 year old Samsung Galaxy 850 is every bit as good as the Apple i15. In fact, I think better in many regards. Apple seems to have gone out of their way to make it difficult if not impossible to personalize many aspects of the phone. I'm very disappointed.",Apple iPhone 15,Black,256GB

I’m oldschool and don’t like not owning my own music and movies so I opted for a 512GB hard drive. The phone itself is an instant upgrade, no scratches, great battery (for now) at 82%. The transfer of all previous apps went seamlessly although I’m holding off on their Face ID.

B07ZZM8P2S,9/20/2024,TRUE,5,Great price and well functioning refurb,"I just had to write this review, as this seller is great! Phone works great, and seller is super quick to reply to issues. What I will warn: NEVER buy the insurance from Asurion thru amazon. Or ever. They will not honor it, they will gladly take your money, insist that you never had insurance with them, and constantly run you in circles to avoid honoring your claim. My phone slid off the counter, and I has the case off so I could charge it, (case didn’t fit) and it cracked. Both Asurion and Amazon refuse to honor the claim, and one amazon rep even went so far as to message the seller that my phone never arrived so the seller would have to refund me. Thankfully I saw the message and let the seller know and they were so so quick to offer their help! Since it was not their fault I took the issue back to the two A’s…and still have yet to hear from them. Want a good phone?? By from THIS seller!!! Insurance for it? Allstate or your private company. Never trust asurion to make good on their word.",Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max,Space Gray,512GB
B07ZZM8P2S,3/29/2023,TRUE,1,Is Renewed Premium worth the extra money?,"Update (12/17/23): Additional observations: 1) the Amazon Renewed certification card is marked 10/27/23, and when I received it 12/2/23 (about 5 weeks), the battery was completely dead; 2) after charging back to 100%, I put it in airplane mode (to turn off both WiFi and bluetooth), and also put it in battery saver mode; I checked the battery percentages once a day, and it was losing 10-15% per day, so this battery is very weak. I did a parallel test with another iPhone (11 pro max), and that one only lost 10% (100% > 90%) over a week. This is an excellent test to check the true condition of the battery. Update (12/15/23): Orde Red a 5th Amazon Premium Renewed phone (iPhone 12 Pro Max), and the battery life, which should be above 90%, is actually 88%. Update (3/28/23): After lengthy discussions with Amazon, they will not honor the 90% battery guarantee stated on the Amazon Premium Renewed page, because it is ""not stated on the Amazon invoice"". 1-star, no longer recommended. Update (2/1/23): Ran into some issues, probably things that should be checked upon receipt of a renewed or premium renewed product: 1) battery life [below advertised 80 or 90%], 2) parts replaced, either with genuine or non-genuine Apple parts, 3) overall functionality [defective charging port].  Reducing overall rating to 4-stars. Summary: Upgrading from an iPhone 7 plus, and decided I would go with the 11 Pro Max version. I was on the fence whether the extra money for the premium renewed is worth it, so will be discussing what I conside Red. Observations: The high level basic differences are: 1) about a $100 difference; 2) three vs. 12 months return period: 3) battery level of 80% vs. 90%. Recommendation: After considering the factors, I decided to look into how much a replacement battery would cost, which is $40 right now. However, starting with the iPhone 8 (i think), Apple started sealing the cases, which requires a heat gun to separate the case because of the extra waterproofing adhesive. To breakdown the addition $100 cost, subtract the $40 battery from that, leaving $60 for an additional 9-months (or $6.67/month) to ""insurance"" to return the phone if issues come up. Carrier Lock: I decided I wanted an unlocked version, and that appears to be another feature that is included with Premium Renewed, with the majority of carrier locked versions being offe Red as renewed only. Conclusion: For the additional $100, I elected to go with the Renewed Premium. I rate both the Renewed and the Premium Renewed as 5-stars. Which you chose would depend on individual financial and personal factors.

B07ZZM8P2S,8/21/2024,TRUE,4,Phone came in good condition !,"This phone looks nice, really, honestly. The phone was neatly packaged and wrapped, came with a charger and a sim card opener + the amazon renewed paper. It had a couple scratches on the sides but they were very minor & not noticeable at all. The screen was very clear no cracks. My only issue is the screen when it’s turned on. It had this weird mild & subtle static & I can see a faint black grain when I am staring closely to the phone. Now I understand this phone is refurbished & renewed but I won’t lie the screen when I have the phone on really bugs me. I would be lying if I said I am totally satisfied with this phone. Not to mention the phone is kinda slow, it lags & the battery life I received when I when I went to the settings was at an 80 % .. *sighs* , trying to decide if I should thug it out & be delusional or just send the phone back even tho I fear the quality of phone I’d received next. I’ve contacted the seller .. I haven’t heard anything yet. I’ll update soon. Update : Ive decided to return the phone because I feel like I would be settling if I had to keep this phone. I will say though I am surprised the phone came in a very good condition. But truly there were internal hardware and software issues in terms of the static screen flickering/blinking that I just couldn't overlook. The seller has been responsive and cooperative. I am thankful. I pray I get my money back on time. As of right now id rate my experience an 8/10 !",Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max,Space Gray,256GB

B09LNSNZM8,4/18/2024,TRUE,3,1st order = low quality replacement screen; but returned/swapped for good phone,"Initially, we got a phone from this vendor that was a dud (for us). We returned it and tried them a 2nd time. The 2nd phone seems a decent deal. For the first phone (iPhone 13) we received: The battery life on the renewed phone was fairly good - at 94% of original capacity. This had been an issue with phones from this vendor per other reviews but was not an issue with ours. However, this renewed phone had a non-Apple replacement screen that was noticeably low in quality - grainy, with colors dulled, and it cut off part of the display area. Touch responsiveness was bad. Given Amazon pledge that the product was ""professionally inspected and tested by Amazon-qualified supplier,"" I feel the substandard screen should have been spotted and the lower quality disclosed. My family member and my time were wasted by this attempt to pass off a lower quality solution. Return process was easy, although it did require a trip to the UPS store. For the second, replacement (iPhone 13) phone: The replacement for the returned 1st phone arrived quickly. The battery life seems great (100% of original capacity). The screen this time is MUCH better than the low quality screen on the original phone. The case has some scratches and a dent on the ring surrounding one of the camera lenses, but the lens seems unaffected. All in all, a fair price for used phone. Working well after a month of use.",Apple iPhone 13,Blue,128GB

All its functions seem to work fine. Haven’t had issues with Apple (since Apple’s notorious fame of disabling features when phone don’t have genuine parts).

B09LNSNZM8,8/23/2024,TRUE,5,Pleasantly surprised,"So let me start out by saying that I am not one to purchased refurbished phones and whenever something would happen to one of mine and I had to turn it into the Phone company and they would send me a refurbished one to replace mine, there was always something wrong with them. So, that has always made me a little bit gunshy regarding that particular situation. With that said, as a full-time caregiver for the last 11 years, I have not been able to work and unfortunately can no longer purchase the best of the best with the flagship phones that I used to get back in the day. Many of my parents doctors do some video visits and some of them actually prefer FaceTime so as a result, having an iPhone was actually partly a necessity for that reason. I have always been an Android girl, )still have that too), so I didn’t quite know what iPhone I needed to get, but after some research, I finally settled on what I thought would be the best choice for me both with regard to the technology inside and with the price as well as the warranty. I had actually conside Red either an iPhone 11 or an iPhone 13 as my choice. As we are now on the 15 I found the 13 to be the wisest choice of the two. After researching many different sites, some very reputable and actually recommended by people, I decided to land on Amazon‘s renewed program because I’ve always had a nice experience when there have been any issues with a product and I’ve never had any problems with customer service. They’ve always been very helpful and I thought if anything were to happen with the phone, I would be hoping to have the same type of experience. In looking at the options, I chose to actually pay more to have one that was put forth by Amazon themselves because they offe Red a year warranty as opposed to many of the others who were a bit cheaper and offe Red maybe 30 days or so etc. And hey, so far, so good! The Phone arrived. It was in perfect cosmetic condition and I have not had any issues with it since. The battery was at 87% and although I would’ve liked to had it higher than that, I was glad to see that it still was pretty snappy when I needed it to be. So I would say that I have been very pleased so far and I would absolutely recommend the renewed program to anyone interested, but can only speak to the actual product provided by Amazon itself, however, I’m sure many of the third-party individuals that sell refurbished items may have some really good product themselves.

What I will warn: NEVER buy the insurance from Asurion thru amazon. Or ever. They will not honor it, they will gladly take your money, insist that you never had insurance with them, and constantly run you in circles to avoid honoring your claim. My phone slid off the counter, and I has the case off so I could charge it, (case didn’t fit) and it cracked. Both Asurion and Amazon refuse to honor the claim, and one amazon rep even went so far as to message the seller that my phone never arrived so the seller would have to refund me. Thankfully I saw the message and let the seller know and they were so so quick to offer their help! Since it was not their fault I took the issue back to the two A’s…and still have yet to hear from them. Want a good phone?? By from THIS seller!!! Insurance for it? Allstate or your private company.

B08159ZYCB,3/29/2023,TRUE,1,Is Renewed Premium worth the extra money?,"Update (12/17/23): Additional observations: 1) the Amazon Renewed certification card is marked 10/27/23, and when I received it 12/2/23 (about 5 weeks), the battery was completely dead; 2) after charging back to 100%, I put it in airplane mode (to turn off both WiFi and bluetooth), and also put it in battery saver mode; I checked the battery percentages once a day, and it was losing 10-15% per day, so this battery is very weak. I did a parallel test with another iPhone (11 pro max), and that one only lost 10% (100% > 90%) over a week. This is an excellent test to check the true condition of the battery. Update (12/15/23): Orde Red a 5th Amazon Premium Renewed phone (iPhone 12 Pro Max), and the battery life, which should be above 90%, is actually 88%. Update (3/28/23): After lengthy discussions with Amazon, they will not honor the 90% battery guarantee stated on the Amazon Premium Renewed page, because it is ""not stated on the Amazon invoice"". 1-star, no longer recommended. Update (2/1/23): Ran into some issues, probably things that should be checked upon receipt of a renewed or premium renewed product: 1) battery life [below advertised 80 or 90%], 2) parts replaced, either with genuine or non-genuine Apple parts, 3) overall functionality [defective charging port].  Reducing overall rating to 4-stars. Summary: Upgrading from an iPhone 7 plus, and decided I would go with the 11 Pro Max version. I was on the fence whether the extra money for the premium renewed is worth it, so will be discussing what I conside Red. Observations: The high level basic differences are: 1) about a $100 difference; 2) three vs. 12 months return period: 3) battery level of 80% vs. 90%. Recommendation: After considering the factors, I decided to look into how much a replacement battery would cost, which is $40 right now. However, starting with the iPhone 8 (i think), Apple started sealing the cases, which requires a heat gun to separate the case because of the extra waterproofing adhesive. To breakdown the addition $100 cost, subtract the $40 battery from that, leaving $60 for an additional 9-months (or $6.67/month) to ""insurance"" to return the phone if issues come up. Carrier Lock: I decided I wanted an unlocked version, and that appears to be another feature that is included with Premium Renewed, with the majority of carrier locked versions being offe Red as renewed only. Conclusion: For the additional $100, I elected to go with the Renewed Premium. I rate both the Renewed and the Premium Renewed as 5-stars. Which you chose would depend on individual financial and personal factors.

The phone’s display is crisp and clear, with vibrant colors that make everything from photos to videos look great. Despite its smaller size, the battery life has been surprisingly decent and holds up well throughout the day with moderate use. Performance is quick and snappy, handling all apps smoothly without any noticeable lag, and the camera quality is impressive. The dual-camera system captures detailed and colorful photos, even in low-light conditions, which has been perfect for on-the-go snapshots. Overall, the iPhone 12 Mini offers a great balance of power and portability, and I’d recommend it to anyone who loves compact, high-quality smartphones.",Apple iPhone 12 Mini,Purple,128GB

B08PNZGSSJ,5/14/2024,TRUE,4,"A great phone, though no replacement for my Iphone SE (1st Generation)","This is a brilliant phone. Yes, it is a few generations down from the newest, and yes these are specifically refurbished as well. Even so! My phone arrived in basically new condition a year ago, and has worked well since. Battery life is...not amazing, but Iphones honestly don't have great battery life. They'll last you through the day depending on your use, but not much past that. That's fine, I charge mine often. 64GB's is plenty for a phone unless you are recording often and keeping a large gallery or a ton of apps. I like the smaller size of the phone, I think phones are getting too big, and this has all the features of a big phone in the smaller package. I like the facial recognition (although it feels dystopian) as it makes unlocking the phone a breeze. I think the camera is very passable, and I like the screen. If not for being worried about dropping it, the outer case is beautiful. Apple outdid themselves. What I don't like. The size...is actually still a bit too big for me. The Iphone SE (1st Generation) used the Iphone 5 frame. I thought that frame was truly amazing, as it wasn't very big at all. Easy to one hand, almost as if designed to be. It in fact *WAS* designed to be. When I first got it, I realized this. It is too big to one hand comfortably, it's not quite so big that 2 hands feels truly right. It's fine, but I feel the mini should have been actually a touch smaller. Also, I honestly kinda dislike having almost all the phone's front be the screen. There's nowhere good to rest your hand to support it without touching the screen. I used to wrap my hand around the phone and support it with my thumb across the front, near where the button was. It's a nitpick, but I just don't dig it as much. For $200~275 though, is it worth it? Ab-so-lutely. It's a great phone, I bought mine I think for near double that, and I only somewhat regretted the price tag. It's held up very nice the past year, and I don't expect to have to replace it for a good number. If not for the busted screen on my old phone, I'd still be rocking it despite a truly not good battery. This one makes for a fine replacement, and if you want a new Iphone, this is the one to get.",Apple iPhone 12 Mini,Midnight,128GB

I was really surprised on how pristine this phone looked upon opening the box. The phone functions as it should, and came pre-installed with IOS 18. I had no issues connecting it with my service provider, so it came carrier unlocked and I get great service with it. I switched to the iPhone 15 Plus from an iPhone 12 Pro Max and so far it has been worth it. No scratches, dents or any visible signs of wear and tear. It even came with a screen protector already on it! The phones battery came at 93% and so far has been pretty good at keeping a charge. My 12 Pro Max had a battery with 90% and would only last maybe 5 or 6 hours from 90% charge. This phones battery has lasted me at least 12 hours or more! Feeling the back is great, it reminds me of a Pro model iPhone since the back glass is matte and not glossy like previous years. I feel like this phone was worth every penny I spent on it I’m getting a 1 year old iPhone for a few hund Red dollars cheaper than what Apple is asking! Thank you, Amazon!",Apple iPhone 15 Plus, Red,128GB

The phone had zero scratch phone quality was A+. I think it was brand new. I love the look at the it was easy to set up. I’m not sure what’s going on with the other ratings but they must’ve broken the phone and then wanted to return it. I’m not sure but I have no complaints. I’ve been using this phone for I think about a year or probably a little over and have zero issues. Thank you!! 😊,Apple iPhone 15 Plus,Green,128GB
B0CMT86BZ7,10/8/2024,TRUE,5,Came in perfect condition,"Perfectly operational with brand new battery. I absolutely love my new phone. I took a chance when I orde Red here, but I feel lucky that nothing was wrong with the product. I tested it extensively, no speaker issues or Bluetooth connectivity problems. Good deal, and I’ll likely buy my next phone from here too. Thank you!!",Apple iPhone 15 Plus,Pink,128GB

B0CMT86BZ7,11/10/2024,TRUE,1,A complete headache for me!,"I purchased this phone a few weeks ago as my old phone broke. When I received the phone (day 1) the screen sticks and after researching the way to fix this is resetting the phone. After having to reset it multiple times a day (by day 3) I said I can’t keep doing this. I contacted the seller and they said they’d be happyyyy (exaggerated) to replace it I would have to have to go through Amazon customer service to submit a replacement request. Contacted customer service and they cannot do a replacement request my only option is a refund. Well that would lead me without a phone and now the prices have increased for another. I purchased the insurance so I take it to the repair company. Well that’s going to cost me… why should I pay for an issue that I had no control of. The phone does have a limited warranty, so the guy told me to take it to Apple. I took it to Apple. They run the diagnostic and they said nothing is wrong and that I just needed to updated to the newest IOS. Next day it still sticks. I take it back to Apple and after running a deeper diagnostics I now have to get a full replacement but they do not have the replacement in store and have to order it in. I come back to get the replacement and as he is submitting the service ticket it will not allow him and says the phone has to be sent in and will take them a week. Long story short I’m back to my broken phone and cannot get a new one or this one fixed. This may just be a one off experience and not necessarily on the seller unless they are selling knowingly with these issues, but it’s a frustration one.",Apple iPhone 15 Plus, Red,128GB
B0CMT86BZ7,11/1/2024,TRUE,5,Phone came in great condition,The phone came in such great condition. I was debating between this phone and the iPhone 14 Pro Max. When I got the phone it came with a charging cable so you have to buy the block. The phone basically looked new no scratches or anything. On apple this phone is going for almost 900 dollars so it is so worth it. If in doubt buy the phone. I got the pink color and it’s so beautiful and the size of the phone is perfect.,Apple iPhone 15 Plus,Blue,256GB

B0BYLNB9P9,11/12/2024,TRUE,1,Refurbished? Never again!!,"When u received it there was a small crack on the upper left corner. I did not think twice about it, loved the phone. After a while, the scratch got bigger and bigger :/ and I had a case in this device since day one!!! Apple support and imma perfectionist when it comes to my expensive items. Now the screen just lights up, I am unable to do ANYTHING!! I can’t even backup my photos… all 43,200 photos that will be lost forever. What can I do? I guess my only recourse is to return the product, and pray to the lord almighty (whom I do not even believe in…) that I get a full refund because the condition these “premium renewed” items come in are second hand, used, broken, spend a lil extra money, and get what you paid for!!",Apple iPhone 14 Pr,White Titanium,256GB

B0BYLNB9P9,7/7/2024,TRUE,5,Say's renewed but I can't tell it was ever used,"On a friday I found out how well an iPhone 12 pro stands up against a 60\"" mower. Turns out not very well. I didn't know that Amazon had renewed iPhone's but I'm glad that I found them! Received the phone the next day. The battery life is at 95% and holds a charge all day. The phone is blemish free. It came packaged well but not in Apple packaging. This phone does not take a physical SIM card and there was nothing left from my old phone so I had to contact my carrier to have an ESIM emailed to me. I was up and going fairly quick. It has been working flawlessly. The camera on this thing is fantastic. I did a little research and didn't see enough difference in the 15 Pro to warrant the increased cost. The 13Pro was a good option but since I was buying used I wanted a newer battery. This has me seriously looking at their other renewed stuff now.",Apple iPhone 14 Pr,Blue Titanium,256GB
B0BYLNB9P9,6/30/2024,TRUE,5,ABSOLUTELY PERFECT,"This is the second premium renewed iPhone I’ve purchased from Amazon and I couldn’t be happier. Cosmetically flawless. Not one single scratch, nick or ding anywhere to be found. Phone arrived with original Apple plastic on screen and back in an Amazon Renewed box. Battery capacity at 95%. The testing checklist card that was included is dated Dec. 2023 so apparently the phone has been in a warehouse for 6 months. Not surprised or disappointed that it didn’t start at 100 %. I’ve seen the reviews that mention distorted speaker sound, dead spots on touch screen, scratches etc. Most of these “bad” phones are purchased from third party sellers. It’s very, very important to buy as SHIPPED FROM AND SOLD BY Amazon. If there’s any problems, you get a 1 year replacement/refund guarantee from Amazon. Third party sellers only offer a 30-60 day policy and it may take several weeks to process your return. Not worth the hassle. Another suggestion: spend a few more bucks and go with Premium Renewed, you won’t be disappointed! This iPhone 14 Pro has a super fast processor, beautiful vivid colors on the screen, holds a charge all day and has great video and still image capabilities. 5 stars all day!",Apple iPhone 14 Pr,Black Titanium,256GB

Pulled the charger out of the plug and both phone and charger were very warm . Let it cool down and got it to charge at last . Phone would lock up on its own ? I had to send it back for a full refund . Amazon was very good about the return and refund ! Thanks Amazon . Still looking for another phone.,Apple iPhone 14 Pr,White Titanium,1TB

I have always had my data transfer Red at the carrier phone store, which takes forever. I turned my new phone on, and it came up with a message to place my old phone next to it and it would automatically transfer all data. I thought - Yeah, right. And then it did. In a flash. And I had thousands of pics on my old phone. Maybe all phones do that, I don't know, but I was very impressed. Not only did EVERYTHING transfer, but to my amazement, it also all came up in the EXACT same order and location it was on my old phone. No rearranging. More importantly, the screens (and backs) of both phones were pristine. The phones were guaranteed to have at least 90% battery life. One had 96%, the other 94%.

B0CK55NFNK,2/10/2024,TRUE,5,"Great quality, and customer service!","For starters; the price on these phones is great. Between having the reassurance of Amazon buyer protection, and the benefit of knowing the device has been tested for performance, it’s well worth it. I needed a new phone fast after my cat knocked mine into the sink ☹️ Rice fixed it for a while, but it was only temporary before it died altogether. I hate buying phones and avoid it whenever possible. 99% of mine belonged to someone in my family first. And i was good with that. Needless to say, my cat didn’t wait for someone in my family to upgrade. I was on my own this time. Okay.... that’s not entirely true. My grandma had an iPhone 7 sitting around so that held me over in the meantime. Going from an iPhone 11 Pro Max to an iPhone 7 was….bad. It was too dam small, in every possible way. 32 gigs of memory!! I needed an upgrade. Fast. My 11 year old was bullying me relentlessly. And that’s on me. They had my old XR (formerly my dad’s) I scou Red FB marketplace. I’d decided upgrade a little, so I could feel better about the switch. I didn’t want to feel backed me into a corner by my cat’s recklessness. I would get a slightly newer model in a fun colour. Marketplace had plenty. Sending message after message from my iPhone 7, I worried. “This person seems too eager”, “this one has been posted so long”, “I want a purple, but the only purple one listed has less storage space” and “the pretty green one has a small crack”, “this guy lives 2 hours from me” and “Battery life? Errr last time I checked it was like 74%?….no, I can’t take a screenshot of it, it’s turned off”…. “cash only please” Etc. So much pressure. What happens if the thing doesn’t work? That’s $300+ down the drain. I knew I couldn’t afford new. But I hated the idea of buying something used from a stranger on Facebook. I didn’t want to get scammed, and I also didn’t want to settle. That’s when I remembe Red good ol’ Amazon. Maybe I’d check there. Just for funsies. Probably out of my budget, but it couldn’t hurt. Sure enough, refurbished devices selling “like new!” Mostly same cost or less than what I’d found so far. Surely there was a catch? I read through everything, tested by Amazon, includes all the specs, unlocked, I can pick the colour, the storage size, the condition, etc. AND I could have it delive Red to me tomorrow??! With a warranty?!! I recove Red from my brief stint of disappointment after learning the 12’s don’t come in yellow. Then fought hard to decide between mint and lavender. The lavender would take an extra day to arrive. Mint it was!! As promised, it arrived the next day. It was in beautiful shape. 128g’s, mint green, not a single scratch, 86% battery life. All for less than I would have paid to some stranger for a 64g with some “small scratches” Once my case and screen protector arrived I excitedly set it up and synced my data. Oh no. The FACE ID DIDNT WORK 😭 After becoming used to facial recognition, having that yanked away, and dealing with a 7 for over 2 weeks— I was desperate for the convenience of Face ID. I had been using my fingerprint. Like a *caveman*. Not to mention I have Blink 182 tickets, and it specifically states facial recognition is requi Red to access the mobile tickets. Idk if that’s true, but I needed Face ID!! I googled, I contacted apple support. Fixing it could be upwards of $300. That’s almost what I paid for the whole phone!! I realllllly didn’t want to be stuck without a phone again. But I also wanted one fully functioning. So I reached out to Amazon support and explained. The rep was inc Redibly helpful (as most Amazon reps are) and after bts failed, she advised the ship was a 3rd party seller, and she send a message to them. “If they don’t fix it by (insert date) contact us back and we’ll make this right” she encouraged. I’m ngl. I was nervous. I didn’t have high hopes, having dealt with 3p sellers on Amazon in the past. At least Amazon had my back, ig. The concert wasn’t till July. Even without facial recognition, it was loads better than the 7. I could make do in the meantime. The seller came in clutch though, and my worry was unwarranted. They responded within minutes. They were receptive, apologetic, and more than willing to help. As I’d anticipated, they offe Red a refund or exchange, as soon as they received the return. I explained my concern with not having a phone for several days or more; and the merchant offe Red to overnight a replacement as soon as the return was dropped off. I could deal with one day without a phone! I gratefully accepted. That was Saturday night, we made plans to catch up Monday for the return instructions and for them to overnight it. Monday I reached back out; and they were ready to ship, BUT they *had no more green….* 🫢 SHOCK “…do you have purple” No. :( just blue, white, and black. THIS WAS A HUGE BUMMER.It’s silly I know, and the definition of *first world problems “.. but I mean…. My change of heart about this whole phone thing HINGED ON THE FUN COLOUR. Without it, I was just a person…out $350… because my cat was thirsty while I was watching YouTube while washing dishes. I needed a cool colour. Plus, I’d already gotten the matching case! Clear with mint green borders. It wasn’t even a fun blue… it was a dark, serious, navy blue. It was pretty and classy, but I wanted something fun. I even asked if he had any older models in yellow 😭😭 no luck, They told me they’d be restocking in a day or so. Still, no greens or purples came in. Ugh. Reality was setting in. I was going to have to settle. It was fine, I thought. At least it would be a fully functioning phone. No. I wasn’t ready to let go. They assu Red me I could take my time to decide, and I asked if we could wait another week in case one came in. If it didn’t, *then* I would choose from the options available. I messaged them Wednesday afternoon, bracing myself for the answer…. THEY GOT IN PURPLE! YAY. They sent a label, I dropped it off, sent a photo, and had my new phone the next morning. they’d said overnight shipping… but wow! I’d dropped off the return around 3pm, and had the replacement by noon the next day. I didn’t even have my new case yet 😅 Despite the Barney-Esque colour scheme my mint green case created, the lavender is GORGEOUS and I’m actually sort of glad the green didn’t work out. Don’t get me wrong, the green is also gorgeous.. but in the end I’m glad I ended up with the lavender. I was overjoyed when I was prompted to set Face ID during setup. Worked brilliantly, as did everything else. Great packaging, no cosmetic flaws, amazing battery life, customer service was great, and best of all… ITS PURPLE! Can’t wait to pair it with the new case. I’m so glad I went this route where I have some peace of mind as a buyer. I’m grateful to the seller for being so helpful and patient with me as insufferable as I must have seemed making such a fuss over colour preference If you’re nervous buying a phone used or refurbished too, hopefully you can take comfort in knowing- this seller is legit. You receive a good quality product, and, speaking from experience, they’ll gladly help resolve any issues you may run into.",Apple iPhone X,Midnight,128GB
B0CK55NFNK,7/23/2024,TRUE,5,Excellent condition,"My reason for purchasing an iPhone was probably different than most people. I have a Samsung phone that use daily and I am very happy with it. It is on a carrier that is not one of the ""big names"". It suits my purposes fine. My mother invited me to accompany her to Europe. This is a once in a lifetime trip for me, but I soon realized my inexpensive Samsung phone would not work there. Believe me, I tried. The best way to have a working phone while in Europe so I could stay in contact with my business was to invest in an iPhone. I decided on the iPhone 12 and bought a refurbished one. I researched the sellers and their profiles before ordering. I finally decided on MOBILESUPPLY because they have an inc Redibly high rating. They did not disappoint! The first phone I purchased was purple. It arrived in excellent condition visually. No scratches, no marks and actually looked like a brand new phone. It charged up to 82% which was great. Everything was wonderful. Then I set it up (which took me a couple of YouTube tutorials being a long time android user). I couldn't hear on the phone without using my earbuds or having it plugged into my vehicle. I thought maybe it was me, so I tested it with several people calling them and having them call me and finally I gave it to my husband, then son to get their opinion. Nope, wasn't me. MOBILESUPPLY answe Red my question immediately and it was no issue to replace the phone. They sent a prepaid label and the same day they received my phone they shipped a new one out to me. The replacement phone was blue, but that isn't an issue. It charges to 93% and again, appears brand new. It works great, I can hear and now I am ready to go on my trip with my Mom. This entire experience was a lot of research and I am so glad I bought from Amazon, and picked the seller I did. My advise is to think of your needs for purchasing a ""new"" phone and to do your research on sellers. Amazon offers an amazing choice to pick from. Hope that helps.",Apple iPhone X,Midnight,128GB
B0CK55NFNK,11/7/2024,TRUE,4,"Great Phone, Minor Flaws, but Worth It!","I purchased a refurbished iPhone 12, and overall, I’m quite satisfied with my experience. Here’s a breakdown of my thoughts: Performance: The A14 Bionic chip delivers impressive performance. Everything from browsing to gaming has been smooth and responsive. I’m glad I chose this model—I can easily multitask without any noticeable lag. Condition: The phone arrived in good condition overall, with minimal signs of wear. However, I did notice a few light scratches on the screen that weren’t mentioned in the description. While they don’t impact functionality, it was a bit disappointing. Camera Quality: The camera takes fantastic photos, and the Night Mode feature is a game-changer. I love capturing memories, and this phone does an excellent job, even in tricky lighting situations. Battery Life: The battery life is decent but could be better. I find myself needing to charge it by the end of the day, especially with heavy usage. It’s not a dealbreaker, but I was expecting a bit more endurance. Value for Money: Considering the savings compa Red to a brand-new device, this refurbished iPhone 12 offers great value. For anyone on a budget, it’s a solid option. In summary, I highly recommend the refurbished iPhone 12 for anyone looking for a reliable smartphone. Just be sure to check the condition carefully beforehand. Happy with my purchase overall!",Apple iPhone X,Green,128GB

B0D3F7RVMM,8/28/2024,TRUE,5,Brand new IPhone 13 Pro,"I purchased this phone as an upgrade for myself as I desperately needed it, I saw mixed reviews on battery life but overall the conditions of the phones seemed to be good. When mine arrived I was very pleasantly surprised when it looked like it was in perfect condition, there wasn’t a single scratch dent scuff or anything of the like on this phone (Trust me I looked everywhere) the phone was clean with no fingerprints and not even dust in the speakers. I later checked the battery condition and saw that it was at a perfect 100%. The phone I got must have been leftover stock never sold from apple, and at the price point of nearly half of the MSRP of this phone when it originally released, I was extremely happy. There were 2 things that decreased my experience ever so slightly. 1: The packaging, it was pretty cheap and poor packaging and didn’t look appealing but it protected the phone and that’s what’s important ( it also came with sim ejector tool) 2: The setup process for the phone, I struggled for 3 hours to get the phone to set up properly, for some reason it would keep getting stuck and I would have to restart and reinstall all updates for the phone, it wouldn’t download my Apple ID or sync my stuff from my old phone, but eventually I came back the next day to try again and it ended up working, not sure what I did differently to fix this issue but none the less the phone ended up working perfectly in the end. One side note: I don’t believe this was a fault of the seller I think this was an Apple issue! After all, I got a brand new iPhone 13 Pro and I am extremely happy and satisfied with this purchase",Apple iPhone 13 Pro,Natural Titanium,256GB

B0D3F7RVMM,9/1/2024,TRUE,4,Excellent product,"As soon as I took the phone out of the box, it looked brand new, which was impressive right away. The exterior was clean, and the sides were spotless, except for a bit of dirt on the silencer and in the speakers, but nothing too concerning. The screen did have some minor scratches that were noticeable without a screen protector, but once the protector was on, they were hardly visible. The phone has the right amount of storage, exactly what I needed. The battery health is at 83%, which isn’t perfect but still acceptable for my usage. I was a bit disappointed when I realized my box didn’t come with a SIM card pin, especially after seeing other reviews mention it. All I received was the phone and a charger. Unfortunately, the charger was subpar, it has a shortage and is not a lightning charger. Thankfully, I had an extra charger on hand, so this issue wasn’t a dealbreaker for me. One small issue I’ve noticed is that the microphone seems to be a bit low when recording voice messages, so I find myself needing to speak louder than usual. However, the overall quality of the phone is good, and I haven’t encounte Red any major problems yet. I feel like this phone was a good value for the money. Despite the minor dirt and the low microphone volume, it came in excellent condition. Setting up the phone was easy, especially since I was moving from Android to iPhone.

I didn’t understand what that meant until i’d called my phone carrier to figure this situation out and i’d been told the phone is black listed and stolen which the seller has been 100% apart of. I don’t want to imagine how much money they have acqui Red from customers hoping to have a renewed phone that is free without issues.

Now, at its worst, it’ll work enough for me to unlock my phone, and then the touchscreen won’t work at all. I have to repeatedly turn it on and off, even full on smacking the screen for it to work. I wish I had bought a new Apple phone because this has been a waste of money. Also, it took me a good 2 hours with tech support from Verizon and Apple to get the eSIM to work.

The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is inc Redibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compa Red to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate.

B09G9D8KRQ,22/06/2024,TRUE,5,Still one of best base flagships out there in 2024,"Things I liked:1. Solid Build Quality and very polished software (compa Red to Samsung's One UI)2. Camera:-Rear: Rear camera is pretty decent with good color accuracy in all lighting conditions. Videos are steady and smooth.3. Mic / Speakers: Mic is exceptionally well, isolates all background sounds in noisy situations. Speakers are crisp with good bass.4. Performance: This is where the phone shines, you can throw any app available on the App store and it will run it without breaking a sweat.5. Face Id works like charm, it's the best biometric phone lock out there undoubtedly.Things I wish were better:1. Battery life would have been better, I get up to 4.30 - 5 Hours SOT with mixed usage (high brightness, 1 hour calls, 2-3 hour social media, and 2 hour media playback/music)2. Charges Slow compa Red to my earlier Samsung. Takes almost 1.2 Hours from 20% to 80%3. Front camera is average, it fails to get correct skin tones and lighting. I keep it on default and still it produces over saturated photos.4. Dialer / phone app sucks. I am someone who makes up to 200 calls a day due to nature of my SCM work. Dialer on Samsung is far better. For unknown call you can add a note to the number in Samsung and it reflect when the person call you again, without having to save unnecessary contacts. Number pad does not detect contact unless complete number is typed.",Apple iPhone 13,Pink,128GB

Cost is wall for me. - The photos are nice and feature like exposure adjust and filter was good and quality photos . And the 5x zoomed photos is not good for me.it  Reduced the pixel quality .- The video and optical image stabilisation was mind blowing . i mostly explore on videos . it was soo good , no words other than that.AND THE BIGGEST FEAR FOR ME NOW IS IOS UPDATEi turned off the auto update at first place .i hea Red about DISPLAY ISSUES,HEATING ISSUES and BUGS in the ios updates for 13 and 14 series.So for expencive and established brand like apple does not fair .

For example, you will have to pay for the premium plan of Truecaller if you want to monitor real-time calls for spam/block.The dialer app on iOS is a mess. It's tedious to find and locate a contact from within the dialer app.Using Gmail, Google Photos and other Google ecosystem apps that they have been using over years flawlessly is also no so smooth and flawless.Using iOS has come to me as a shocking experience of using my phone with excessive restrictions of the OS.Even the apps on Android OS are more flawless and smooth than on iOS.Last but not the least, if you're using Windows on your PC/laptop, an Android phone compliments more than what an Apple phone does. To this, you can see how seriously Microsoft is developing apps for Android.So, it was a productivity loss to switch from Android to iOS if you're a Windows user.",Apple iPhone 13,Pink,128GB
B09G9D8KRQ,7/10/2023,TRUE,1,It is a total waste of money!,"Things to remember before you buy an Iphone -1) It is good only untill its warranty is there, for extended warranty, it is 10k approx for one year.2) Under warranty also, it's resell value is only 25k in Apple store, so this itself explains that the mobile is over-priced, and that's why resell value under warranty is 25k which is it's actual value.3) Once the warranty expires - Apple will keep on bringing in updated versions and the updated versions will mall function in a 1 year old Iphone as well. Problems include - Green screen, network issues, etc.4) Many people Iphones underwent Green Screen after the latest update and as their Iphone was not under warranty had to spend 400$ or 11k to 15k depending upon their model for screen repair or change. Meaning Apple company will release update, because of which the Iphone will malfunction and people have to spend money inorder to repair it.5) Iphone - covers, tampe Red glass are all very expensive and are of third class quality and design. Even after spending 1500 to 2000 INR for an Iphone cover, it will last only for 6-8 months. After that, either it will become dull, dirty or look ugly or pale. An android cover of 250 Rs also functions the same way.6) Apps - That is a total scam everyone knows that. You have to pay for many apps and many apps are still unavailable in App StoreMoral of the story -You can buy an expensive Iphone and use it comfortable for a year or maximum 2. So, if you are ready to spend so much money just for a year, it is the best mobile. For long run, this is just a scam that it will last for a long run.Joke of the year - You will be prompted with features that Iphone and Macbook's only have! - The only issue is, comman man never uses those features! So, people inorder to prove that this is a very unique feature, unnecessarily use it, show it and claim that it could be done only because they have an Iphone.

Doesn’t take good selfies. Literally bad at taking selfies makes you look more ugly.2. Touch is ok ok not as per apple standards but it’s soft.3. Literally hard to transfer data from android to iPhone.4. iCloud storage is only 3GB after that you need to pay for upgrade, better go for 128GB variant.5. No jack for headphones it is only compatible with Bluetooth headphones, another drawback which I was not aware before buying.6. Most of you would be aware that it doesn’t comes with a charger and you have to buy separately.7. If your hands are wet this phone won’t work. I don’t know if it’s really ip68 waterproof kinda stuff because earlier I had Samsung galaxy S8 and it used to work in water and with wet hands also.Overall, it is highly overpriced as per the features.

The notification center can become overwhelming, often leading to many unread notifications that can be easily missed.2. The absence of a back gesture makes navigation less intuitive and can be frustrating for users accustomed to this feature on other devices.3. The camera struggles to focus on small text, making it difficult to capture clear images of detailed documents or fine print.4.

Major problem I am facing is in Potrait mode whenever I click 2-3 photos in portrait mode camera app crashes automatically.I don't know it's because of IOS version17.0.3 or something else.I received latest software version update of IOS 17.1.1 but im sure whether I should update or I should wait because I experienced the performance drop after updating to 17.0.3.I contacted customer support with my issue regarding camera but they didn’t gave me satisfactory resolution, they just told me to update my phone to latest Software version.Overall phone is nice.",Apple iPhone 13,Midnight,128GB

B0CHX1W1XY,3/12/2023,TRUE,5,The BEST iPhone EVERRRRRRR! : iPhone 15 review after 2 weeks of continuous use,"The display is impressively bright, despite the 60 Hz, which I thought might be a drawback coming from a 120 Hz Android device. Surprisingly, it feels the same. The battery life is solid, providing around 1.5 days for mild phone users. As a developer, with light usage for content consumption and social media, I get around 8 hours of screen on time with 25-30% battery left. It charges quickly to 50% and then trickle charges to 100%, adapting to usage patterns for faster charging. Initially, there were some battery drain and heating issues, but they resolved as the phone learned my usage patterns.Now, the camera is impressive, especially in low light conditions. Despite lacking a dedicated long exposure mode, the default night option, averaging around 3 seconds, captures details even in the dark. Compa Red to the iPhone 14 and S21FE, the camera quality is top-notch. The auto portrait detection is a standout feature. Believe me no one explain the real use of that auto portrait theoretically until you try it.In terms of network, the dual 5G standby supports Vi and JIO 5G (eSim). Inside my house, I get around 500 Mbps, and outside easily surpass 1GBps. Call quality is excellent, with two introduced modes in the mic option available in the control center.This is my personal opinion; I'll update if I find anything noteworthy.",Apple iPhone 15,Black,128GB

Thankfully, it ended up in the hands of someone who wasn’t very tech-savvy and couldn’t figure out how to turn it off using the key combination.

B0CHX1W1XY,24/07/2024,FALSE,1,Do not buy with exchange,"*Nothing to say about the iPhone. It’s the best that is available.*Lot to say about Amazon’s delivery and exchange. Unfortunately had the idea to buy this with exchange of iPhone XR (bought from Amazon itself, invoice existing). On first attempt, the deliver agent says code fro rabbit exchange not working let me re attempt the delivery tomorrow. That tomorrow became 2 days, after lot of phone calls with Amazon and emails to and fro on 2nd attempt The rabbit exchange app that Amazon is mandating for exchange passed all the test (including battery at 80% life). But in the summery showed ‘mri_battery genuine’ and ‘mri_camera genuine’ as failed and generated a code which the delivery agent couldn’t input in his mobile. Says exchange is rejected ( mind you no message to that effect was displayed in his app), promptly cancels order and goes away.And that is the end of me buying high value electronic goods from Amazon.Do a favour do not buy with exchange from Amazon! You would save yourselves a lot of hassle.And Congratulations Amazon india folks on completing the process to make Amazon the worst customer centric company.
